## 📌 How the Bot Handles Long Replies

If your reply to `!query`, `!ask`, or `!chat` is longer than Discord's 2000-character message limit, the bot will automatically create a new thread for you in the channel.  
The full response will be posted in multiple messages within that thread, and you'll be notified in the main channel with a link to the thread.  
This keeps long answers organized and prevents cluttering the main chat.

---

## Setup Guide

### 1. Register Your Bot with Discord

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click **"New Application"** and give your bot a name.
3. Go to the **"Bot"** tab, click **"Add Bot"**, and confirm.
4. Under **"Token"**, click **"Reset Token"** and copy your bot token.  
   _You’ll need this for your `.env` file!_

5. Under **"OAuth2" > "URL Generator"**, select:
   - `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes
   - Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Add Reactions`, etc.
6. Copy the generated invite link and use it to invite your bot to your server.

### 2. Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Sign up or log in at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Go to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create a new secret key.
3. Copy your API key for your `.env` file.

### 3. Configure Your Environment

Create a `.env` file in your project directory with the following:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
ADMIN_USER_ID=your-discord-user-id-here
```

- To get your Discord user ID, enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings > Advanced), then right-click your username and select "Copy ID".

### 4. Create the `funbot` Role

- In your Discord server, go to **Server Settings > Roles**.
- Click **Create Role**, name it `funbot`, and save.
- Assign the `funbot` role to any members who should be able to use the bot.

### 5. Install Dependencies & Run

Install Python dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the bot:

```sh
python3 main.py
```
or, if you made it executable:
```sh
./main.py
```

---

## Persistent Configuration: `myconfig.json`

The bot uses a `myconfig.json` file to store persistent settings, such as the maximum number of tokens (response length) for each command, debugging options, and chat thread retention.

- On first run, if `myconfig.json` does not exist, the bot will automatically copy the default `config.json` to `myconfig.json`.
- All configuration changes (via admin commands) are saved to `myconfig.json`, so your settings are preserved even if you update or re-clone the repository.
- The original `config.json` serves as a template and will never be modified by the bot.

**Only the user with `ADMIN_USER_ID` can change these values using the admin commands.**

Example `config.json` (template):

```json
{
  "_info": [
    "This file stores persistent configuration for your Discord bot.",
    "The 'max_tokens' section controls the maximum number of tokens (words/characters) returned by OpenAI for each command.",
    "Increasing these values will result in longer responses, but may also increase your OpenAI API usage and costs.",
    "Only the user with ADMIN_USER_ID can change these values using the bot's admin commands.",
    "Be cautious: very high values can quickly consume your OpenAI quota or incur unexpected charges.",
    "The 'tokenuse' option enables token usage debugging. If set to true, the bot will report token usage after each ChatGPT-based command.",
    "The 'chat_thread_retention_days' option controls how many days chat threads and their memory are kept before automatic cleanup. Only the user with ADMIN_USER_ID can change this value."
  ],
  "max_tokens": {
    "feelgood": 80,
    "inspo": 60,
    "bday": 90,
    "joke": 60,

  },
  "tokenuse": false,
  "required_role": "funbot",
  "chat_thread_retention_days": 7,
  "prompts": {
    "feelgood": {
      "generic": "Craft a warm, uplifting, 50-word message that feels like a heartfelt hug from a close friend, addressed to {user}. Make it gentle, kind, and encouraging — the sort of note someone would want to reread on a tough day.",
      "targeted": "Craft a warm, uplifting, 50-word message that feels like a heartfelt hug from a close friend, addressed to {recipient}. Make it gentle, kind, and encouraging — the sort of note someone would want to reread on a tough day."
    },
    "inspo": {
      "generic": "Create a powerful, original inspirational quote, directly addressed to {user}, that feels like a mentor’s wisdom wrapped in poetic simplicity. Avoid clichés. Think soul-stirring and memorable — something they'd want to frame.",
      "targeted": "Write a powerful, original inspirational quote for {recipient}, something they’d want to remember forever. Avoid clichés. Make it feel like deep wisdom spoken by someone who knows their journey."
    },
    "bday": {
      "generic": "Write a chaotic-good, emoji-stuffed birthday message for {username}, full of memes, good vibes, and ridiculous levels of hype. Make it perfect for Discord culture, like it came from an over-caffeinated bestie."
    },
    "joke": {
      "generic": "Give me a wholesome, random joke that’s clever enough to make an adult chuckle, but clean enough to share with kids. Avoid groan-worthy dad jokes — make it feel clever and sweet.",
      "targeted": "Tell me a clever, family-friendly joke about {topic} that would make even grandma laugh and a kid repeat it at dinner."
    },
    "compliment": {
      "generic": "Write a heartfelt, Discord-friendly compliment from {sender} to {recipient}, focused on celebrating what makes them genuinely special. Keep it specific, kind, and warm — like a friend who really sees them.",
      "targeted": "Write a meaningful compliment from {sender} to {recipient} about {topic}, Discord-ready and full of charm. Avoid general flattery. Make it feel like a real friend appreciating the exact thing that matters."
    },
    "advice": {
      "generic": "Offer a short, sincere piece of advice someone would give to a close friend who needed a quiet moment of truth — kind, but unflinching.",
      "targeted": "You're a wise, empathetic guide with a knack for giving grounded, real-talk advice. Share a short but sincere insight about {topic}, like you'd offer to a close friend who's quietly struggling but not saying much."
    }
  }
}
```

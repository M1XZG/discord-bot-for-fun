## Game Features

### üåü Rarity System
Fish are categorized into seven rarity tiers that affect catch rates:
- **Ultra-Legendary** (Deep Pink) - Rarest of all (0.5% weight) - Diamond Ring
- **Legendary** (Gold) - Extremely rare (1% weight) - Blue Whale
- **Epic** (Purple) - Very rare (5% weight) - Great White Shark, Hammerhead Shark, Narwhal
- **Rare** (Blue) - Rare catches (15% weight) - Marlin, Sailfish, Barracuda, Tarpon
- **Uncommon** (Green) - Less common (30% weight) - Sea-Bass, Smallmouth-Bass, Bonefish
- **Common** (Gray) - Most fish (50% weight) - Most standard fish
- **Junk** (Brown) - Trash items (60% weight) - Stinky-Boot, Worn-Trainers

### üìã Fish Descriptions
Each fish includes a unique description that adds flavor to your catch, like:
- *"The apex predator of the ocean, both feared and respected worldwide."* (Great White Shark)
- *"A tiny marine marvel where males carry and birth the young."* (Seahorse)
- *"A priceless engagement ring lost at sea. Someone's heartbreak is your treasure!"* (Diamond Ring)
- *"A single rotting boot filled with mysterious sludge. Even the fish avoid this putrid footwear."* (Stinky-Boot)

### üíé Ultra-Legendary Catches
The rarest tier includes special treasures:
- **Diamond Ring**: Despite being tiny (2-5cm), can mysteriously weigh up to 50kg!
  - Minimum points: ~2 (light ring)
  - Maximum points: ~505 (heavy treasure)
  - With contest bonus: up to 757 points!

### üé≤ Catch Variety System
The game uses smart randomization to ensure variety:
- Tracks your last 10 catches to avoid repetition
- Uses weighted selection based on rarity
- 15% chance to catch nothing (shows consolation message with No-Fish.png)
- 1 in 50 chance to "catch" a server member instead of a fish!

### üóëÔ∏è Junk Catches
Sometimes you'll pull up trash instead of fish:
- **Stinky-Boot**: Weight ranges from 0.3-15kg for variable points
- **Worn-Trainers**: Old sneakers with weights from 0.4-20kg
- These items have humorous descriptions and count towards your stats!

## Fishing Mechanics

### Points Calculation
Points are calculated based on both size and weight:
```
Base Points = (weight_kg √ó 10) + size_cm
```
Maximum points are capped at 2√ó the fish's theoretical maximum to prevent outliers.

### Cooldowns
- Default: 30 seconds between casts
- Cooldowns are **disabled** during contests
- Admins can adjust or disable cooldowns
- Shows exact time remaining if you try to fish too soon

### Special Catches
- **Server Members**: Occasionally you might "catch" another server member!
  - Worth 1000+ points
  - Shows their avatar
  - Weight: 55-140 kg
  - Still possible during contests!
- **No Catch**: Sometimes the fish just aren't biting
  - 15% chance
  - Shows random consolation message
  - Displays No-Fish.png if available
  - No points or database entry

## Contests

### Contest Features
- **Dedicated Thread**: Each contest gets its own thread in the channel
- **No Cooldowns**: Fish as fast as you want during contests
- **50% Point Bonus**: All catches worth 1.5x points
- **Auto-Duration**: Contests run for a set time (default 5 minutes)
- **Live Updates**: See catches in real-time in the thread
- **Final Results**: Automatic leaderboard when contest ends
- **Thread Management**: Threads are locked and archived after contests

## Tips for Players

1. **Check conditions**: Use `!fishconditions` to see all available fish by rarity
2. **Join contests**: No cooldowns and 50% bonus points!
3. **Check the leaderboard**: Use `!fishstats` to see where you rank
4. **Learn about fish**: Use `!fishinfo` to study your catches
5. **Variety is key**: The game prevents repeat catches for better variety
6. **Don't give up**: Even junk catches earn points!

## Database Storage

All catches are stored in `fishing_game.db` with:
- User information

- Timestamps
- Contest associations
- Rarity tracking

This allows for persistent leaderboards, statistics tracking, and contest history.

## Asset Requirements

### Fish Images
